## Usage

Please install corresponding PyTorch version in the first place. You may refer to [PyTorch Official Website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for more information. Projects under this repository are written and tested under [CUDA 11.6](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html) + [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/) + [PyTorch 1.12.1](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/), and may need to be adapted for users of other versions. 

Once PyTorch is installed, please execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install other dependencies.
